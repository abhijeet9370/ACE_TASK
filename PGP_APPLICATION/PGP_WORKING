-----------Working Of PGP----------------

🔐 1. Key Generation
	Each user creates:

	A public key (shared with others)

	A private key (kept secret)

	These are used for asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA or ECC).

📤 2. Encrypting a Message
	When Alice wants to send a secure message to Bob:

	a. Message is compressed
	To reduce size and add a bit of security.

	b. A random session key is generated
	A one-time symmetric key (e.g., AES) is created.

	The message is encrypted using this fast symmetric key.

	c. Session key is encrypted with Bob's public key
	The encrypted session key is sent along with the message.

	So the final package includes:

	Encrypted message

	Encrypted session key

📥 3. Decrypting a Message
	When Bob receives the message:

	a. Decrypts the session key
	Bob uses his private key to decrypt the session key.

	b. Decrypts the message
	Uses the decrypted session key to decrypt the message content.

✍️ 4. Digital Signature (Optional, but common)
	If Alice wants to prove she sent the message:

	a. Hash the message
	Create a digest (e.g., SHA-256)

	b. Encrypt the hash with her private key
	This becomes her digital signature

	c. Attach signature to the message
	So Bob can verify it

d. Verification
	Bob decrypts the signature with Alice's public key

	Compares it to the message hash to check authenticity and integrity
